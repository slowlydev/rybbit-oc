# How to Calculate Bounce Rate with Rybbit Analytics

Bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page. For anyone running a website, this number matters, it shows whether people find what they're looking for or bail immediately. Rybbit makes tracking bounce rate simple, and I'll walk you through everything you need to know.

## Understanding Bounce Rate

A bounce happens when someone lands on your site and leaves without clicking anywhere else. That's it. The bounce rate is just the percentage of these single-page sessions compared to total sessions.

High bounce rates aren't always terrible. Someone might read your entire 2,000-word guide, get their answer, and close the tab feeling satisfied. But if users hit your homepage and immediately leave? That signals a real problem.

## Accessing Your Bounce Rate Data

Once you've added the Rybbit tracking script (takes about five minutes), bounce rate data appears immediately in your dashboard.

### Dashboard Access

Log into [app.rybbit.io](https://app.rybbit.io) and select your website from the list.

### Main Metrics View

Your bounce rate sits right on the main dashboard next to:
- Unique Users
- Sessions
- Pageviews
- Pages Per Session
- Session Duration

The interface stays clean and simple. No digging through buried menus for your key numbers are front and center.

## The Math Behind Bounce Rate

Rybbit calculates bounce rate with this formula:

`
Bounce Rate = (Single-Page Sessions ÷ Total Sessions) × 100
`

**Real example:** You had 1,000 sessions yesterday. 350 were single-page visits. Your bounce rate: 35%.

For more on session behavior and user engagement patterns, see our [Sessions Tab Guide](/docs/behavior-analytics/sessions) and [Churn Rate vs Retention Rate article](/blog/churn-rate-vs-retention-rate).

## Segmenting Your Data

Rybbit's filtering capabilities let you dig into the "why" behind your bounce rate numbers.

### Traffic Source Comparison

Click "Referrer" or "UTM Source" to compare channels:

- **Organic Search:** Your SEO pages converting?
- **Social Media:** How do Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook visitors behave?
- **Direct Traffic:** Performance from bookmarks and typed URLs
- **Paid Campaigns:** Getting ROI from paid traffic?

### Device Breakdown

Mobile users behave differently than desktop users. Filter by device type:
- Desktop
- Mobile

If mobile bounce rates run significantly higher, your mobile experience needs work.

### Geographic Patterns

The Location Filter shows bounce rates by country, region, and city. Useful for spotting regional issues or informing localization choices.

### Advanced Filtering Options

Rybbit offers 15+ dimensions for detailed segmentation:
- Browser and Browser Version
- Operating System
- Screen Resolution
- Language
- UTM parameters (Campaign, Medium, Term, Content)

You can easily select the right filter at the top of the page of your main dashboard

## Real-Time Monitoring

Rybbit shows bounce rate changes as they happen. This matters during:
- Campaign launches
- New content releases
- A/B tests
- Site updates

## Historical Trend Analysis

Looking at bounce rate over time reveals patterns and shows whether your optimizations work.

### Time Range Selection

Pick your date range from the top of your dashboard:
- Today
- Yesterday
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days
- Custom date range

### Pattern Recognition

The bounce rate graph shows you what's happening over time. Watch for:
- **Spikes:** Something caused a sudden jump—what was it?
- **Declines:** Did your recent changes help?
- **Weekly rhythms:** Certain days consistently different?
- **Seasonal shifts:** How does time of year affect behavior?

### Setting Up a Funnel

1. Navigate to Funnels
2. Click "Create Funnel"
3. Map your steps (Landing Page → Product Page → Cart → Checkout)
4. Analyze drop-off rates

Your first step drop-off equals your bounce rate for that entry point.

## Core Web Vitals Monitoring

Page performance impacts bounce rate. Rybbit automatically measures Core Web Vitals:
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** How fast the main content loads
- **FID (First Input Delay):** How quickly the page responds to interactions
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Visual stability during loading

Poor scores here often match high bounce rates.

# Actionable Ways to Reduce Bounce Rate

Now that you know how to track bounce rate, here's how to improve it:

### 1. Improve Load Speed
Check Web Vitals data, find slow pages, fix them.

### 2. Align Content with Expectations
Review referrer data, do landing pages deliver what traffic sources promise?

### 3. Optimize Mobile Experience
High mobile bounce rates mean your mobile site needs attention now.

### 4. Clarify Next Steps
Watch session replays to see if users understand where to go next.

### 5. Match Content to Headlines
Blog posts with high bounces often fail to deliver what titles promise.

### 6. Fix Technical Issues
Session replays expose broken elements, confusing navigation, error messages.

### 7. Improve Audience Targeting
Use UTM tracking to measure campaign-level bounce rates and adjust targeting.
